        <p>Deisgn Fuego was all about introducting myself through a coding platform. In this, I introduced my major, skills for the course, ideas on good design, future plans, and included some personal pictures for people to be able to see into my life. </p>

This design was the easiest to understand and made users feel the happiest. </p>

After looking through multiple online images, I was able to find one that spoke to me as a good design. I wrote about and determined which aspects were visually pleasing- the artist had amazing choices of text fonts, colors, and design details. This project highlighted key ideas we have been discussing when it comes to creating your own design.  </p>

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>When you're creating a design, it is important to consider what message you are conveying.  You also must make sure the message is appropriate and not in any way disrespecting a population/group. Once you decide what you'd like to convey, there are endless options as to which platform of design technology you use. In this class, I have learned how to be mindful of message sent out. I've also learned how important it is to put time into your work as many different people may view it. Technology is all around in the world today, and it's important to be mindful of what you create.</p>

            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>Throughout the course, we have been reading chapters on design principles. After all the reading, we got to discuss with the class what stuck out to us in addition to what we liked/ disliked. After the reading, we were able to apply this in our design work. This is showcased in the 'good design' piece. I now feel as though I can look at a piece and describe why it logically and visually makes sense and what are some things to change or to improve on. This skill can be used in all aspects of my career- on resumes, cover letters, articles, ect.</p>

             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p>At the start of most classes, we reflect by writing a discussion post about the reading we did and afterwards get to talk with others around us. Hearing other people's opinions is extremely eye-opening and it is cool to see how everyone interprets things differently. In addition, we get to share the pieces we have created and hear about other people's opinions, critiques, and improvement ideas on them. This discussion time has not only led me to see modifications I could make to my own pieces but also to see what different unique ideas are out there. I love getting to see how other people think and approach each assignment. This skill can be used when presenting any findings I have. It is important to be able to accept criticism and not get upset by it but rather learn and grow from it.</p>

              <p>During workshops, we discuss with people around us difficulties we had and people can give their feedback. I found in this class a lot of times I am not confident in my pieces but feel much more confident after talking to others around me. I think it's important to be able to revise your work in order to grow as a designer. Revisions are an amazing thing- I have revised my work after seeing classmates outstanding creations and learning from what they have tried.</p>

              <p>During the second week of classes, we got to present out Design Fuego in front of the whole room. While it was partially nerve-racking, it made me feel much more connected to my classmates around me. This class has taught me different things about my presenting style- I found I prefer to present on the same level as the audience as opposed to me standing in front speaking while they sit and watch. Presentation skills are something I think every person can continually improve upon, and I plan on continuously trying to make improvements to how I present my work- making sure it is engaging, easy to understand, I'm projecting my voice well, ect.</p>

I modified everything, and this is the final course flyer for Topics in Creative Writing: Creative Disability.

            <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
               <p>When creating any design, there's a few key things to be mindful of. All designs convey a message and have a voice, so you need to be mindful of what message you're trying to convey. You also need to realize once designs are put out for the world to see, they are there for good and there is no removing them. Every person has a digital footprint so you must make sure everything has a purpose in the design, and it will not be offensive, inappropriate, or unethical. Ethics are huge in design, especially in the age we live in. There sometimes is a fine line between what you publish your opinion, and what is harming a person/group/idea. An example of this was my client's design project. The class itself is an open discussion safe place, but you still need to be careful of what exactly you show. There is a difference between having a class discussion on the topic and making a course flyer since the flyer is open for interpretation and I as the designer am not there to explain what I meant in each part. In this project, and as a designer in general creating any content, want to express a clear message but sometimes a clear message may be interpreted wrongfully and in turn, become unethical. In this situation, it's really a matter of creating a balance between the two, getting other people's unbiased opinions, and double-checking to ensure what you put out there is okay.</p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
               <p>In every single design you create, it’s important to leverage design principles to have the best possible work. In the Two-Page Spread, I tried to replicate a preexisting design. This forced me to pay particular attention to different font choices and try and understand why the designer chose what they did. For the graphic design resume, I used many different design principles: contrast (navy and white for different information), repetition (same subheading for each aspect of the resume), emphasis (drawing the eye to my name first and the image above), balance (ensuring there was still white space). For my final client project, I used design principles to create a simplistic, easy-to-read piece. My client said she wanted it to be extremely accessible so I created a simplistic visually appealing style. Design principles are extremely important to understand so you can apply them in the designs you create.

     <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
               <p>In every class workshop, we present the design we have to classmates and use their feedback to improve our design. I have found modifying my work based on viewer feedback has been extremely beneficial. In my water bottle advertisement, I struggled a lot with the text for the “For every time you…..” sentence. My peers told me I needed to make the bold words stand out more since it was hard to differentiate so I exaggerated them more and it made the piece look a lot more put together and less confusing. Another really beneficial comment was during the presentation of our client projects. My peer said you should include a for more information section contact ____ section which pushed me to make my design more clear and communicate more. From there, I had the idea to include all the course codes, time sections, and the professor so students wouldn’t need to find more information if they had it presented right in the advertisement. In design, it's easy to get frustrated with your work or to overlook something that isn’t communicated to your audience. Workshop user feedback allows you to get an outsider's opinion about how your future views will see your piece.

               <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
               <p>This course focuses on revising your own work in multiple different media platforms. In design, there is always room for continuous improvement in your work. On the two Page Spreads, I got really close to achieving the original work aside from the New York front- there was nothing similar on InDesign, and no way to replicate that font without buying online fonts. For the graphic design resume, I originally had the relevant experience section laid out with the course above, the description below, and the QR code awkwardly in the middle with a description underneath. I deleted the entire section, starting a new way of laying it out, and ended up really liking the course on the left with the description on the right. As mentioned previously, I came into the workshop dissatisfied with the text but with trial and error of different sizes, boldness, and spacing, I found one that fit a lot better. Design is all about creating a piece originally, and making modifications that clarify and improve your piece.</p>

               <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
               <p>Every week, we present to classmates our project for that workshop. Through this, I’ve gotten a lot better at explaining my thought process to other peers/designers. When you are forced to show your copy to another designer with different thoughts, you talk through each step and decision made and can see where the gaps are or where you need to evaluate. The Client Project was an extremely beneficial skill. I presented my three different samples and talked through what aspects I tried to focus on in each piece. Throughout all these presentations, I learned how I should break down my work in order to get the most efficient feedback. When you can evaluate specific aspects, you can if your audience agrees with each different piece or what parts they need more clarity in. Presenting my work used to be a fear where I felt embarrassed that my design was bad, but I now enjoy showing it and view it as a starting basis. Viewing it as a starting basis leads you to grow and be a better designer- everyone thinks differently and for that reason, we all need to be able to present our work and make improvements on it.</p>

        <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
           <p>Rhetoric, Technology, and Ethics play a huge part in this course. For every design you make, you need to consciously make sure what you communicate is not offensive or limiting others around you. I personally faced this challenge in my four-page spread. I have been really into fitness for the past few years and used this as an opportunity to promote going to the gym and answer some misconceptions or excuses people may have made about themselves at the gym. I wanted to motivate people without hurting them and pushing them down. Questions like: ‘ Can you say people are lazy? Can you tell them going strong for a week and quitting rather than starting off slow and being consistent is just wrong?’  came up. I had to balance what I said to make sure I was communicating in a positive tone and not being offensive. I had my roommates review my work and tell me if they thought any of my words were offensive and needed to be changed.  I think it's really important when designing on any technology platform to be extremely careful to follow ethics. If people were to view my work, I am not there to explain myself and things can always be interpreted in a different way. You must try and consider outsiders' points of view. And to be extra safe, actually ask audience viewers before publishing any designs since everyone views things differently and all opinions matter.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
           <p>Design Principles have been carried throughout the course in every design I have done. In my 10-page spread, I really used balance and repetition to make a cohesive article that I would be proud to have people read. Discounting the two introduction phases, I kept the format the same so it was consistent throughout making it easier for viewers to process the restaurant information. I also included hierarchy: I did big bright pictures and the store logo on top so people could see if they were interested and if they were they could look at the text below to give more information on the store. This makes it visually appealing since you can get the gist of a restaurant without having to read descriptions and you only really need to read descriptions of restaurants that appeal to you. In our UX design branding, I leveraged the design principles of alignment, contrast, and variety: the alignment is all centered, the contrast of green in the four was for visual appeal and also helped break up the words before and after it, and the variety was an image with two different types of text. Design principles are something we naturally follow but referencing them can be beneficial to help improve your designs and make it communicate your idea more effectively. 
          </p>
 </div>

 <div class="col-sm-4">
          <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
           <p>Presenting work is something we do in almost every workshop. In a workshop, you pull up your current project in the developmental stage you’re in and you hear other people's feedback. This can be extremely beneficial when you get stuck or are unsure of what direction your design should take you. For our 4-page spread, I ideated the idea of having a different color background and showed my classmates and they all said they liked the white background best. In the UX Design branding workshop, it was extremely helpful to listen to classmates' thoughts on the clarity of my brand before I ran testing. This led me to have better options for each category and make sure my audience getting tested wouldn’t be confused. Overall the workshop is beneficial to better your work. You have to go in with an understanding that critiques are beneficial and they are not meant in a mean or malicious way. Workshops give you extremely valuable opinions and help improve your work, and no matter how ‘good’ of a designer you may be, you can always benefit from them. My biggest takeaway this entire semester was to go into them excited to hear about potential new improvement ideas rather than (how I did the first workshop) thinking my work was terrible and having other people's critiques be taken to heart and upset me.

           <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
           <p>Revision is a beautiful thing when it comes to design. It’s a never-ending process where you’re constantly shifting details. We listened to a podcast called ‘Welcomed by Design Podcast’ where she talked about UX designs never being finished said there is no "perfect model" and referenced how "Rome wasn't built in a day". In our final UX design project on branding, we went through multiple stages of testing and revision. In one workshop, I introduced my brand logo, mission statement, color swatches, and fonts to my three classmates. They all gave a difference of opinion which led me to change my mission statement and go into my research with previous outsiders' opinions. From that, I tested and changed my color swatch. In another workshop, I heard their opinions on my logos for eats4you and modified them again before I went into user testing. I think the entire revision process is somewhat scary in that it can be never-ending but also really enjoyable. The more you iterate, the more you can see how far your initial design has come. One design you may have previously thought was good and finished- and then you can talk to more people and come up with an even better design than more. I am appreciative now of revisions throughout all my designs in all different media platforms and will take what I have learned and apply it to any future designs I need to make.

           <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
           <p>I’ve learned to present my work by talking in groups for workshops, displaying it on the whiteboards in the front of the room, and presenting it in larger groups in front of classmates in a more formal style. We did formal presentations in front of classmates for UX design which our class hasn’t done since the original UX design study at the start of the semester. This really showed me that I have learned a lot about my presenting preference throughout each class and design project we’ve done this semester. I like when there is no time rush on presenting- when there is a time crunch I tend to talk really fast and not communicate as well. I also found I enjoy talking and then having questions / open conversations at the end. I think that keeps people more engaged since they can have their own thoughts and know I will hear their idea after and I enjoy getting people's preferences once I’ve said all I have to say. I’m still learning how to present better, but overall I have lost a lot of my nervousness since we’ve presented our work every week and heard people's feedback. Presenting is a great way to get good feedback and figure out exactly what point you’re trying to communicate.
